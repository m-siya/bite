# Bite Language and it's compiler


Bite is a fresh and innovative programming language, inspired by the concept of a "byte" in the computer world. Our unique twist on programming is the incorporation of culinary terms and concepts to make coding a delicious experience.

## Introduction

Welcome to the Bite language repository! In this repository, you'll find everything you need to get started with Bite, including the source code for the compiler, scanner, virtual machine (VM), and more, all implemented in Rust. 

## Language Features

Bite's syntax is designed to be both intuitive and enjoyable to work with. Here are some of the key language features:

- **Variable Declarations**:
 ingredient variable_name = expression

- **Statements**: Bite supports various types of statements, including if, print, return, while, for, break, and continue. See [BiteGrammar.txt](BiteGrammar.txt) for detailed information.


## Project Status

This project is currently a work in progress. We are actively developing Bite and working on improving its features, performance, and documentation.

## Usage

To get started with Bite, clone the repository to your local machine, build the compiler and other tools using Rust, and start writing Bite programs.
